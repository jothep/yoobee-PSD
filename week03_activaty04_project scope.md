YB College needs a relational database to manage students, classes, subjects, and lecturers, and to track both class offerings and student enrollments. The core entities are Student (id, name, address, class_id), Class (id, class_name, description), Subject (id, subject_name), and Lecturer (id, lecturer_name, subject_id). Each student belongs to exactly one class; classes offer many subjects via the CLASS_SUBJECTS junction table; and students enroll in many subjects via the STUDENTS_SUBJECTS junction table. Each lecturer is associated with exactly one subject. This schema supports tasks such as listing a classâ€™s subjects, finding the students taking a subject, and assigning lecturers to the subjects they teach.
